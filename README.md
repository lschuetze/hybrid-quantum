<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project aims to develop a comprehensive framework for quantum computing that includes a collection of quantum-specific dialects, enabling targeted backends and progressive lowering to Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) and LLVM IR. By implementing optimization passes tailored for the quantum dialect, we seek to enhance the performance and efficiency of quantum algorithms. Additionally, this framework will facilitate the integration of classical dialects, allowing for seamless collaboration between quantum and classical computing paradigms. These features are essential for improving the programmability and usability of quantum architectures, making them more accessible to researchers and developers while promoting interoperability across various quantum platforms.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you can build the framework locally.

### Prerequisites

QUMIN depends on a patched version of `LLVM 18.1.6`.
Additionally, a number of software packages are required to build it, like `CMake`. 

### Download and Build 

The repository contains a script, `build.sh` that installs all needed dependencies and builds the sources.

* Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tud-ccc/Cinnamon.git
   ```
* Build the sources
   ```sh
   cd Cinnamon
   chmod +x build.sh
   ./build.sh
   ```


# Setup instructions

- Create a file named `.env` in the clone directory
- In this file, write `LLVM_BUILD_DIR="<path/to/llvm-project/build"` with an absolute path, eg
```shell
LLVM_BUILD_DIR="/home/clem/Documents/CCC/cinnamon-oot/llvm/build"
```
It should point to the build directory, whatever it is named.

Your LLVM version should be
```
6f89431c3d4de87df6d76cf7ffa73bfa881607b7
```
which you need to fetch from https://github.com/oowekyala/llvm-project

### Linker config

To reduce link times, install the `mold` linker and
```shell
echo "CMAKE_LINKER_TYPE=MOLD\n" >> .env
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Run build.sh when running first time. 
Use run.sh when you want to recompile the code after changes. 
The script file test.sh runs a script to check all operation implementation, optimisation pass, lowering to llvm ir etc.
